# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Fashion MNIST

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using TensorFlow and Keras. The VAE is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, and the code includes functions for training the model and visualizing the latent space.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script containing the implementation of the VAE and the training process.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy tensorflow keras matplotlib
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Libraries Used

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): End-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): Deep learning API for building and training neural networks.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Technology Used

- Python: Programming language for implementing the algorithm.
- TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training the VAE model.
- Jupyter Notebook: (Optional) For interactive development and visualization.
